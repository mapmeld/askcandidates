# AskCandidates

When I was in college in 2008, I used the YouTube API to show Barack Obama's
answers to hundreds of questions over the course of the campaign. If you
started typing "economy", the autocomplete would show several questions which
had been asked at different events, interviews, town halls, and debates. Clicking
one would direct the YouTube player to the correct video and time.
<a href="http://sugo-katta.appspot.com/askobama.html">Many of the videos still work!</a>

I'm remaking the page in jQuery and Bootstrap, with a plan to support all major candidates.

## Candidates

* Ted Cruz
* Rand Paul
* Hillary Clinton
* Marco Rubio
* Bernie Sanders

Candidates should be added after they officially declare their intention to run
for president in 2016. The name of the candidate should be a common spelling
used by CNN, the New York Times, and/or the Economist, and not unnecessarily
formal (for example: Theodore Cruz, Hillary Rodham Clinton).

## Questions

Include a YouTube URL and time when the candidate begins to respond to the
question. You can include the question itself, but only if the next
person to speak is the candidate.

Questions should only be added if the candidate responded by audio or video,
after announcing his/her candidacy. For example, Hillary Clinton's responses
to the 2008 debates would not be included in this site.

Questions should not be added from any scripted video (advertisements, etc).
